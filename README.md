# What is?
Aimed at interested people in starting to study the acoustic and eletric guitar, cavaco and bass, as well as teachers of this art, the Cordaria project is a web application that aims to help students practice the instrument.

Developed by musician and programmer Lu Sacramento, the project is the result of research into new methodologies and approaches to distance music teaching.

# What does it do?
Its function is to generate basic typing exercises with a focus on technique. These exercises help the student to execute the given notes through tablature writing, with language that is easy to understand compared to sheet music writing.

This way, the student can practice with the help of a virtual “repeater”, at any time and place!

# How did it come about?
Using his knowledge from a decade as a teacher and a few years as a web developer, Lu implemented an application for practicing basic guitar and bass exercises based on some methods he had already experienced as a student and teacher. In this way, Cordaria intends to expand the methodological possibilities of practical teaching of these instruments in a distance learning setting and offer a different opportunity for initiation into the art of music making, in addition to encouraging programmers and teachers to think of new ways of learning.
